    "For convenience, we will keep using the peak set called by cellranger here. Note that there is a difference in peak length distribution. However, in general there are no peaks > 1000 bp; and most peaks have a length in order of 10^3 so let's keep using this one. Note that the original training CRE peak set has a unified length of 400 bp.\n",
