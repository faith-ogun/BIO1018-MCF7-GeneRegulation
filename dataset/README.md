# Datasets for BIO1018 - MCF7 Gene Regulation Project

This folder contains key datasets for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models in my final year dissertation project on gene regulation in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line.

### ðŸ“‚ Old Files
- **`MCF7_IDR_thresholded_peaks.bed`** â€“ Processed ATAC-seq peaks indicating open chromatin regions.
- **`cCRE_hg38.bed.gz`** â€“ Chromatin regulatory elements for the human genome (GRCh38).
- **`gene_quantifications.tsv`** â€“ Gene-level RNA-seq quantifications.
- **`peak_counts.txt`** â€“ Counts of chromatin accessibility peaks for classification tasks.

### ðŸ“¥ Additional Resource
You can download the **`Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.113.gtf.gz`** annotation file from the Ensembl website: [Ensembl GTF Downloads](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)

These datasets serve as input for some of Jupyter notebooks in this project. Be sure to preprocess them as described in the corresponding notebooks.
